# FindNVML
# --------
#
# Find the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) includes and library. NVML documentation
# is available at: http://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/nvml-api/index.html 
#
# NVML is part of the GPU Deployment Kit (GDK) and GPU_DEPLOYMENT_KIT_ROOT_DIR can
# be specified if the GPU Deployment Kit is not installed in a default location.
#
# FindNVML defines the following variables: 
#
#   NVML_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find nvml.h, etc.
#   NVML_LIBRARY, the libraries needed to use NVML.
#   NVML_FOUND, If false, do not try to use NVML.
